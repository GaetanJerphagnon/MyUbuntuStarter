# Ubuntu 22.04 Tool starter pack

This tool is intended for PHP web developpers.

Its purpose is to quickly install basic/most used applications or libraries on a freshly installed Ubuntu 22.04 operating system.

Once you've cloned this repo, I recommend you running the following command :
```
sh init.sh
```
It'll update and upgrade Linux's packages list then you'll be prompted a Makefile menu.

You can run `make all` as suggested, and all the tool stack will be downloaded and installed one by one.
